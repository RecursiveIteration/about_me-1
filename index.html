        <h1>Here's everything you ever wanted to know about me!</h1>
        <p>I have been tryig to get into the IT field, preferably programming such as web design or software development, for a few years now. I started while I was in school and have been trying ever since until the wonderful Apprenti program came along. Within a few months I was interviewing with large companies such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Amazon</li>
            <li>Microsoft</li>
          </ul>
          Fast forward a few months, here I sit at CodeFellows learning/brushing up on my previously learned skills from my undergrad and Master's programs. I worked for a while as a web development intern but it wasn't going to turn into a paying job so I quit after six months. Prior to that I worked as a bank teller. My goal is to successfully finish my current education so I can start the year-long on-th-job training contract I have with Microsoft. After that I hope to get hired on permanently with Microsoft, although if that doesn't work I know that between CodeFellows and Microsoft I will have learned some valuable life and job skills that should make me successful anywhere I go.
